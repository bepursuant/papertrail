# papertrail — architecture plan (POC)

papertrail lets an HTTPS web app start a document scan on the user's Windows PC (TWAIN scanner) and get the pages back in JavaScript. It is proprietary software of Pursuant Solutions (all rights reserved; Pursuant may distribute it free or paid).

## 1. Decisions

| Area | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | **Windows 10/11 workstations only.** No terminal servers / multi-user RDS hosts, no macOS/Linux, no WIA. | Agreed scope for the POC. The core and API stay cross-platform only so they build and test on Linux CI. |
| Runtime | .NET 10 (LTS), C#. Windows app targets `net10.0-windows`; core + API are plain `net10.0` so they build and test on Linux/CI. | Current LTS (supported to Nov 2028). |
| Process model | **Per-user tray app** (WinForms `NotifyIcon`), auto-start at sign-in through `HKCU\…\Run`. **Not** a Windows service. One instance per signed-in user. | Services run in session 0 with no interactive desktop. TWAIN drivers need a message loop and window, and often show their own UI. The pairing dialog must appear on the user's desktop. Per-user also means no admin rights are needed. |
| TWAIN library | **NTwain 3.7.6 (MIT)**, pinned. Native (DIB) and file transfers are converted to PNG with `System.Drawing`; memory transfers are assembled by `StripImageAssembler` (Core). | NTwain is stable and MIT since 3.6/3.7; 4.0 is still beta (re-evaluate later). NAPS2.Sdk (LGPL) and Saraff.Twain (LGPL) are excluded. |
| TWAIN threading | **One `TwainThread` per backend**: an STA thread running a WinForms message loop with a hidden window. Every TWAIN call (open the manager and source, capability negotiation, enable, transfers, close) runs on it; NTwain is opened with `WindowsFormsMessageLoopHook` on that window, and the window is the `hParent` passed to `MSG_ENABLEDS`. A scan is a `TwainScan` driven by NTwain's events, with a watchdog (2 min without progress, 5 min during a transfer or while the driver's own window is open) that fails it with `scan_timeout`; `ScanJobManager` adds a 15-minute backstop. If the thread is still stuck in a driver call 15 s after a failure, the next job gets a new thread. Capability sets that fail are logged with their TWAIN condition code and skipped; the scan uses the source's values. `--diagnose-scanner` / `--test-scan` run the same backend in a separate process. | The first hardware test hung: capabilities were set from a different thread than the one that opened the source (sources such as the WIA-TWAIN layer reject that, so every set failed), and `hParent` was null, so a TWAIN 1.x source's transfer-ready window message was lost. TWAIN 1.x sources on the old `twain_32.dll` have no callbacks; the app must pump messages and pass them to `MSG_PROCESSEVENT` on the thread that owns the source. NTwain's `StopOnTransferError` is left off because NTwain 3.7 treats a page's `TWRC_XFERDONE` as an error there and drops the remaining pages. |
| Bitness | **win-x86 only** (`RuntimeIdentifier` fixed in `Papertrail.App.csproj`). No x64 build, no out-of-process workers. | A process only sees TWAIN sources of its own bitness. 32-bit drivers are the common case, and many scanners ship nothing else. |
| Publish | **Framework-dependent, single file**: one `Papertrail.exe` of about 0.55 MB. Needs the x86 **.NET Desktop Runtime 10** and **ASP.NET Core Runtime 10**, which the MSI checks for. | The self-contained build was 186 MB in 410 files. The two runtimes are free Microsoft downloads (about 56 MB + 11 MB installers), installed once per machine and serviced by Microsoft Update. |
| DSM | Use the `TWAINDSM.dll` (or legacy `twain_32.dll`) that scanner drivers install. **We do not redistribute the DSM.** | The TWAIN DSM is LGPL-2.1. Calling the copy already installed on the system via P/Invoke does not ship LGPL code. |
| Result transport | **Local HTTP API on `http://127.0.0.1:47115`** (Kestrel minimal API) with JSON and polling. Pages are returned as image downloads. | Browsers treat `127.0.0.1` as potentially trustworthy, so it is not blocked as mixed content. HTTP is simpler than WebSocket and is covered by the Local Network Access permission everywhere. |
| Port | **Always 47115.** Not configurable in settings or policy, and no fallback ports. If the port is taken, the app says so and the client reports `not_running`. | One well-known endpoint keeps the client simple. Without terminal-server support, there is one instance per machine in practice. |
| Output format | **PNG only** for the POC. `ScanOptions.Format` (`OutputFormat` enum, `format` in the API and `papertrail://`) is already plumbed through; unknown values are rejected as `invalid_options`. | Adding PDF later means: add `OutputFormat.Pdf`, accept it in `OutputFormats.TryParse`, and add a branch to the encoders in `MockScannerBackend` and `TwainScan.Encode` (plus memory transfers in `TwainScan.FinishMemoryPage`). A multipage PDF would be assembled once all pages are in (one result instead of N pages), using an MIT/Apache writer such as PdfSharp 6 (MIT). |
| `papertrail://` role | **Launch + start scan only; it never carries results.** `papertrail://launch` starts the app. `papertrail://scan?v=1&origin=…&request=<id>&dpi=…` starts the app and queues a scan under a client-chosen random id. The page then collects the result over the HTTP API, where the `Origin` header *is* verifiable. | A protocol launch has no trustworthy caller identity, so any page or email could fire it. Results are released only to a page whose real `Origin` matches and which knows the 128-bit request id. A spoofed launch therefore yields nothing. |
| Protocol registration | `HKCU\Software\Classes\papertrail` (`URL Protocol`, `shell\open\command = "…\Papertrail.exe" "%1"`), written by the MSI. `Papertrail.exe --register` / `--unregister` and a first-run self-check write the same keys for portable use. Single instance: a second launch forwards its URL to the running instance over a current-user-only named pipe. | Per-user, no admin rights needed. |
| Installer | **Per-user MSI only, built with WiX Toolset 5.0.2** (staying on 5.x). Sources: `installer/Papertrail.wxs` (package), `installer/Dialogs.wxs` (screens), `installer/License.rtf` (license text); built by `scripts/build-msi.ps1`. Installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Papertrail` with no elevation prompt; registers the protocol handler and sign-in auto-start in HKCU, adds a Start menu shortcut, and starts the app. Screens: a runtime check that appears only when an x86 runtime is missing (each runtime shown as Missing/Installed, a Download button per missing one that opens the exact x86 installer URL, and **Check again**, which reopens the installer so it re-detects and continues); the license agreement with an accept box; progress; finished. Running it again offers Repair; uninstall is via Settings > Apps. Silent/basic installs skip the screens, and a missing runtime blocks them with a message naming both direct links. Upgrades (also same-version rebuilds) stop the running app first (`Papertrail.exe --exit`) and re-enable sign-in auto-start. Signing: `signtool` signs `Papertrail.exe` and the MSI when a certificate is given (thumbprint or PFX via parameters or `PAPERTRAIL_SIGN_*` variables). No bootstrapper `.exe`. | WiX 5 is MS-RL with no Open Source Maintenance Fee (v6+ requires the fee from revenue-generating users). MS-RL applies to WiX's own source, not to MSIs built with it. The screens are our own authoring rather than the WiX UI extension, whose license dialogs need a WiX custom-action DLL inside the MSI; so the MSI still contains no WiX code. A dialog button can only run custom actions, not the standard AppSearch, hence "Check again" relaunches `msiexec` (no script or DLL custom action). The runtimes themselves are per-machine Microsoft installers, so they need admin once; papertrail does not. Inno Setup (no MSI, commercial license requested) and Velopack (own `Setup.exe` and updater) don't fit an MSI requirement. |
| Policy | `%ProgramData%\Papertrail\policy.json` only. **No GPO/ADMX.** | Agreed. Admins can push the file with any deployment tool. |

## 2. Security model

1. **Origin allowlist ("pairing"), the only user prompt.** Every API request must carry a browser `Origin`. Allowed origins are `https://…`, plus `http://localhost` and `http://127.0.0.1` for development (this can be turned off by policy). `null`, `file://` and requests with no Origin are rejected.
   - The first time a site calls `POST /v1/pair`, the tray app shows "Allow *https://app.example.com* to use your scanners?". The dialog says that the site will then be able to scan whenever it asks.
   - A yes is saved to `%APPDATA%\Papertrail\settings.json`. Sites are removed in the tray menu's "Approved websites" window.
   - A no is remembered for 10 minutes so a site can't spam prompts. Only one prompt is shown at a time, and it times out after 2 minutes.
   - Admins can pre-approve origins (no prompt at all), or turn pairing off, in `policy.json`.
2. **No per-scan prompt.** After pairing, `POST /v1/scans` starts scanning straight away. papertrail adds no dialog, and it turns off the driver's progress indicator (`CAP_INDICATORS = false`) unless the page asks for the driver UI (`showDriverUi`). This is sized for about 1,000 scans per user per day.
3. **Protocol-launched scans need a claim.** A scan started from a `papertrail://scan` link (paired origins only; it never triggers pairing) is queued but does **not** move paper until the named origin polls `GET /v1/scans/{request id}` over HTTP, where the browser's `Origin` is verifiable. If no claim arrives within 30 seconds, the job ends as `canceled` with code `not_claimed`. Without the per-scan prompt, this is what stops a forged link from a third-party page or email from running the scanner for a paired site. The JS client claims automatically because it polls immediately.
4. **Job binding.** A scan job belongs to the origin that created (or claimed) it. Other origins get 404. Jobs and pages live only in memory and expire after 10 minutes or on `DELETE`.
5. **Transport hardening.** The server binds to loopback only. It checks the `Host` header (`127.0.0.1|localhost|[::1]:port`) to block DNS rebinding. CORS is reflected per request for valid origins (no `*`), with no credentials. It answers legacy PNA preflights harmlessly. One scan runs at a time.
6. **Out of scope.** Malicious local processes: they can already reach the scanner directly. Fingerprinting: a non-paired *valid* origin can learn that papertrail is installed via `/v1/status`, but only after the browser's Local Network Access prompt is granted.

## 3. Browser constraints (verified Oct 2026)

- **Local Network Access (Chrome/Edge 14x+, Firefox).** A public HTTPS page that fetches `127.0.0.1` gets a one-time *loopback-network* permission prompt. The JS client therefore:
  - passes `targetAddressSpace: 'loopback'` to `fetch` (this also gives the mixed-content exemption);
  - checks `navigator.permissions.query({name:'loopback-network'})` (never the legacy `'local-network-access'` name);
  - makes the first call from a user click.
  - Enterprises can pre-grant via policy (Chrome/Edge LNA allowlist policies; Firefox `LocalNetworkAccess.SkipDomains`).
  - The PNA preflight headers are deprecated; we only echo them.
- **Iframes** need `allow="loopback-network"` and a matching `Permissions-Policy` on the top-level document.
- **Protocol prompts.** Chrome/Edge show "Open papertrail?" (with "always allow *site*"); the name is the file description of `Papertrail.exe`. Firefox shows a handler chooser. These must be triggered from a user gesture. If the handler isn't installed, nothing happens, so the client detects this by timing out. Enterprises can suppress the prompt with `AutoLaunchProtocolsFromOrigins` (Chrome/Edge). With auto-start at sign-in, the app is normally already running, so day-to-day scans go straight to the HTTP API and never show this prompt.
- **Sites must be HTTPS.** LNA is auto-denied on insecure public origins.

Steady state for a paired site on a machine where the LNA permission is granted: one click on the page, scan, no dialogs.

## 4. Local API (v1)

| Method & path | Who | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/status` | any valid origin | `{app, version, apiVersion, backend, paired, pairingAllowed}` |
| `POST /v1/pair` | any valid origin | Shows the pairing prompt; returns `{paired}` |
| `GET /v1/scanners` | paired | List sources |
| `POST /v1/scans` | paired | `{scannerId?, dpi, colorMode, duplex, source, showDriverUi, maxPages, format: "png", barcodes?, barcodeFormats?}` → `202 {id, status, format, …}` |
| `GET /v1/scans/{id}` | job owner | Status (`queued`, `scanning`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`) plus page list, and barcodes when requested. Also claims a protocol-launched job |
| `GET /v1/scans/{id}/pages/{n}` | job owner | `image/png` |
| `DELETE /v1/scans/{id}` | job owner | Discard |

JS client (`clients/js/papertrail.js`, an ES module with no dependencies): `status()`, `pair()`, `listScanners()`, and `scan(options)`. If the app is not reachable, `scan` falls back to `papertrail://scan` and polls by request id (which claims the job).

### Barcode recognition

Optional, off unless the request sets `barcodes: true` (the same flag in a `papertrail://scan` link and in `scan()`). `barcodeFormats` restricts the search; the default is QR, Data Matrix, PDF417, Code 128, Code 39, EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, UPC-E and ITF. Aztec, Code 93 and Codabar are available by name.

`ScanJobManager` copies each page's bytes in the scanner callback and queues them to `BarcodeWorker` (at most two below-normal threads), so detection never runs on the TWAIN thread and it sees the page before anything else, such as a stamp, can change it. The job stays `scanning` until the pages are analysed or 30 seconds after the scanner finishes, whichever is first. Each page gets 3 seconds. A page is `done`, `partial` (budget ran out), `failed` (the image could not be read) or `skipped`. Nothing about barcodes fails the scan.

ZXing.Net reads luminance from papertrail's own PNG decoder (no image-binding package). QR, Data Matrix, Aztec and PDF417 are searched at any angle; 1D codes are searched with the page turned 0/90/180/270. `TryHarder` is on, and the upright pass also uses `TryInverted`. Pages larger than 12 million pixels (past 300 dpi on A4) are shrunk first. A UPC-E or EAN-8 read that lies along a longer 1D code is dropped.

On this machine, one page, decode plus detection, median of three runs:

| | 200 dpi (1654×2338) | 300 dpi (2481×3507) |
|---|---|---|
| Blank page | 107 ms | 147 ms |
| Text page, no codes | 122 ms | 215 ms |
| Sheet of 12 codes | 1.0 s | 1.6 s |

A scan of several pages overlaps this with the next sheet, so the wait after the scanner finishes is about one page's worth.

## 5. Repository layout

`src/Papertrail.Core` (models, URI parser, origin policy, jobs, settings, mock scanner with built-in PNG encoder) · `src/Papertrail.Server` (Kestrel API) · `src/Papertrail.Twain` (NTwain backend) · `src/Papertrail.App` (Windows tray app, dialogs, registry) · `src/Papertrail.DevHost` (cross-platform headless host with the mock scanner) · `samples/Papertrail.SampleSite` + `samples/web` (demo page) · `clients/js` · `installer/` (WiX source) · `branding/` (logo SVGs, `papertrail.ico`, icon build script) · `scripts/` (tests, MSI build, `test-twain-wine.sh`) · `tests/*` (unit/API tests; `tests/twain-wine`: fake TWAIN source and probe for Wine).

## 6. Dependencies and licenses

Rule: nothing shipped may be GPL, LGPL, AGPL or "non-commercial", and no build tool may charge commercial users.

| Dependency | Used by | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET 10 runtime, ASP.NET Core, Windows Desktop (WinForms/WPF, System.Drawing) | all | MIT | Not bundled: the user installs Microsoft's x86 runtimes (framework-dependent publish). |
| NTwain 3.7.6 | Papertrail.Twain | MIT | Pin ≥3.7. Earlier (≤3.5.x) NuGet metadata pointed to an external license file; do not use them. |
| ZXing.Net 0.16.11 | Papertrail.Core | Apache-2.0 | Barcode detection. The core package only: no bindings, no native code. `lib/net9.0/zxing.dll` has no dependencies. |
| TWAIN DSM (`TWAINDSM.dll`) | runtime, system | LGPL-2.1 | **Not redistributed**; installed by scanner drivers. |
| WiX Toolset 5.0.2 (`wix` local .NET tool) | MSI build only | MS-RL | Not shipped: no WiX extensions or custom-action DLLs in the MSI. Do not move to v6+ (OSMF fee). |
| xunit 2.9.x | tests only | Apache-2.0 | |
| xunit.runner.visualstudio, Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk, coverlet.collector | tests only | MIT/Apache-2.0/MIT | |
| Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost | tests only | MIT | |
| **Excluded** | | | NAPS2.Sdk (LGPL), Saraff.Twain (LGPL), Dynamsoft (commercial), WiX v6+ binaries (OSMF fee), Inno Setup (commercial license requested; no MSI), ZXing.Net.Bindings.ImageSharp (pulls SixLabors ImageSharp, whose license charges revenue), ZXing.Net.Bindings.SkiaSharp (large native library), ZBar (LGPL). |

The JS client and sample page have no third-party dependencies.

## 7. Open questions

None blocking the POC. Inputs still needed before a release: the real license text (replace `installer/License.rtf`) and a code-signing certificate (`PAPERTRAIL_SIGN_*`).

Barcode recognition, still open:

- Is the 10-format default right, or should a page always name formats? ITF in particular false-reads more than the others.
- Should the 3-second page budget be set by the page or by policy?
- 1D codes past about 10° of skew, and Data Matrix past about 15°, are not read. Extra angle passes would catch them and cost about as much again per pass.
- Results are text only. Callers may want the raw bytes of a binary QR or PDF417.
- Aztec is detected, but ZXing's points don't show which way it is turned, so `orientation` is omitted.
