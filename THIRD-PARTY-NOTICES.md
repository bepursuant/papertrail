# Third-party notices

papertrail is proprietary software of Pursuant Solutions (see `LICENSE`), which may distribute
it free or for a fee. Every component shipped with it must therefore be under a permissive
license (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD or similar). GPL, LGPL, AGPL and "non-commercial" components are not
allowed, and neither are build tools whose license charges commercial users. Check these tables
before adding a package to `Directory.Packages.props` or a tool to `.config/dotnet-tools.json`.

## Shipped with the Windows app

| Component | Version | License | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET runtime, ASP.NET Core (Kestrel), Windows Desktop (WinForms, WPF, System.Drawing) | 10.0 | MIT | https://github.com/dotnet |
| Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions | 10.0.14 | MIT | https://github.com/dotnet/runtime |
| NTwain | 3.7.6 | MIT | https://github.com/soukoku/ntwain |

`Papertrail.exe` is a framework-dependent build: the .NET runtimes are not inside the MSI. Users
install Microsoft's own x86 .NET Desktop Runtime and ASP.NET Core Runtime (MIT), which the MSI
checks for.

## Used at runtime but not distributed

| Component | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TWAIN Data Source Manager (`TWAINDSM.dll` / `twain_32.dll`) | LGPL-2.1 | Installed by scanner drivers into the Windows system directory and loaded from there. papertrail must **not** bundle it. |
| .NET Desktop Runtime 10 and ASP.NET Core Runtime 10 (x86) | MIT | Installed by the user or an admin from Microsoft; see the README. |

## Build and test only (not shipped)

| Component | Version | License |
|---|---|---|
| WiX Toolset (`wix` .NET tool, builds the MSI) | 5.0.2 | MS-RL |
| xunit | 2.9.3 | Apache-2.0 |
| xunit.runner.visualstudio | 3.1.4 | Apache-2.0 |
| Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk | 17.14.1 | MIT |
| Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost | 10.0.14 | MIT |
| coverlet.collector | 6.0.4 | MIT |

WiX 5.0.2 is the last release that is free for commercial use: WiX v6 and later require
revenue-generating users to pay the Open Source Maintenance Fee. Its license, MS-RL, covers the
WiX toolset's own source files. It places no terms on MSI packages built with it. The papertrail
MSI uses no WiX extensions or custom-action DLLs, so it contains no WiX code at all: only
`Papertrail.exe` and Windows Installer tables. Do not upgrade the tool past 5.x without settling
the fee.

The JS client (`clients/js`) and the sample page have no third-party dependencies.

## Logo and icons

The papertrail logo (`branding/logo.svg`, `branding/logo-16.svg`) is original artwork made for
papertrail and owned by Pursuant Solutions: hand-written SVG with no fonts, clip art, icon sets or
generated images. `branding/papertrail.ico` and `samples/web/logo.svg` are produced from it by
`branding/build-icons.mjs`, our own script with no npm dependencies. The script rasterizes the
SVGs with a locally installed Google Chrome or Chromium, used only as a build tool. The output
images carry no third-party terms. The sample page's header text uses the visitor's system font
(Segoe UI on Windows); no font is shipped.

## Considered and rejected

| Component | Reason |
|---|---|
| NAPS2.Sdk | LGPL |
| Saraff.Twain.NET | LGPL-3.0 |
| Dynamic Web TWAIN / Dynamsoft .NET TWAIN | Commercial license |
| NTwain 3.5.x and earlier | NuGet metadata points to an external license file rather than an SPDX MIT expression. Pin 3.7+ |
| WiX Toolset v6+ (prebuilt binaries) | Revenue-generating users must pay the Open Source Maintenance Fee |
| WiX Toolset v4 | Same license as v5 (MS-RL) but older. v5 is the newer fee-free release |
| Inno Setup | Produces EXE setups, not MSI, and commercial users are asked to buy a license |
| Velopack | MIT, but built around its own `Setup.exe` and updater; the chosen format is a plain MSI |
